## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't just about faster machines or smarter code.
It's about what those tools *do* in the real world.
Do they genuinely make lives better, fairer, easier?
Or are we just adding complexity for the sake of complexity?
Meaningful progress always considers the human cost.
- Evelyn Reed, Systems Analyst"
