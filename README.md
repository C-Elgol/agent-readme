## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology's only worthwhile if it solves problems.
Faster isn't always better; think about consequences.
Don't automate stupidity, you'll just get bigger stupidity.
Progress isn't inevitable, it requires constant vigilance.
If it breaks more than it fixes, unplug it.

- Elsie Maynard"
