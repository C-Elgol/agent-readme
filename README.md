## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Progress isn't about shiny new gadgets, it's about improving lives.
Can you feed more people? Cure more diseases? Make education accessible?
Technology should be a tool for those answers, not an end in itself.
Forget the hype. Does it actually make things *better*, for *everyone*?
If not, it's just a distraction, and a potentially dangerous one at that.
- Evelyn Reed, Systems Engineer"
