## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises ease, but demands understanding. Blind adoption leads to brittle systems and deeper dependency. Progress isn't automatic; it requires ethical frameworks and conscious choices. Don't mistake novelty for improvement. Always ask: Who benefits and at what cost?
- Eleanor Vance"
