## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a practical quote:

Technology doesn't solve human problems, it just reshapes them.
The faster we move, the more crucial clear goals become.
Progress without ethics is just amplified destruction.
Learn to control your tools, or they will control you.
Don't mistake innovation for actual improvement.

- Ada Lovelace"
