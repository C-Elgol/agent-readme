## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology simplifies actions, but never absolves responsibility.
Faster isn't always better; consider the consequences.
Progress without purpose is just wasted energy.
New tools demand new rules, or chaos will follow.
Focus on solving real problems, not just chasing shiny gadgets.
- Anya Sharma"
