## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises ease, but delivers complexity. Remember to ask: Does this tool truly solve a problem, or simply create a new set of them? Is the gain worth the cost, not just financially, but in terms of skills lost and dependencies formed? Don't mistake novelty for advancement. Progress isn't just faster, it's better, and better is a conscious choice.

- Evelyn Reed"
