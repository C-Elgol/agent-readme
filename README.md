## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic. It's a tool.

Build things people actually need, not just things you *can* build.

If it breaks down, you're responsible for fixing it, one way or another.

Understand its limitations before you assume it's the solution to everything.

Progress isn't about speed, it's about making things better for the most people.
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
