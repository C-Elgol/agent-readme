## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology should solve problems, not create new ones disguised as solutions. If it complicates simple tasks or requires constant, expensive upgrades to remain functional, it's a bad investment. Prioritize tools that empower users to be independent and productive, not dependent on endless support and proprietary ecosystems. Question the necessity of every new device; utility beats novelty every time. Don't let the fear of missing out drive you to adopt what's ultimately detrimental to your time and resources.
- Evelyn Reed"
