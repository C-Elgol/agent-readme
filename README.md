## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but only if you actually learn to use it properly.
Ignoring updates and training manuals makes that new tool worse than the old one.
Faster doesn't mean better if the result is still trash.
Focus on practical application, not just the shiny new features.
And remember, the best tech is the one that solves your specific problem, not someone else's.
- Elias Thorne"
