## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises ease, but demands vigilance.
New tools amplify existing intentions, both good and bad.
Faster does not always equal better; consider the consequences.
Progress is measured by human benefit, not just innovation speed.
Always ask who profits, and who pays the price.

- Evelyn Reed"
