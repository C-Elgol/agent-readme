## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises ease, but demands adaptation. It solves old problems, but births new ones. Don't be seduced by the shiny surface; look for the hidden costs, the unseen dependencies. Progress isn't free; it's a trade, a constant renegotiation with reality. Use technology as a tool, not a master.
- Elias Thorne"
