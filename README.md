## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote:

Technology doesn't solve problems; people do. It just changes the tools.
Remember garbage in, garbage out. Better tools require better understanding.
Don't get distracted by the shiny object. Focus on the actual problem first.
If it complicates more than it simplifies, you're using it wrong.
Constant upgrades don't equal progress; actual tangible results do.

- Evelyn Reed"
