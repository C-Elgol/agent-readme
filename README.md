## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology doesn't solve problems; it only changes them.

Faster doesn't always mean better, just more efficient.

Progress requires more than just new gadgets; it needs new ethics.

The responsibility for a technology's impact lies with the user, not the inventor.

If you automate a broken process, you simply automate a bigger mess.

- Eleanor Vance"
