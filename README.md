## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances because problems demand solutions.
Don't get lost in the shiny object; focus on the useful tool.
Progress isn't automatic; it requires constant questioning.
Consider the implications before deploying any new system.
If it breaks more than it helps, rethink your approach entirely.
- Alan Turing II"
