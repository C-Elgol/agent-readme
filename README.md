## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a practical quote about technology and progress:

"Technology's promise is efficiency. But efficiency without a clear purpose simply amplifies existing problems faster. Before deploying any new tool, ask: What specific improvement are we aiming for, and how will we measure its real impact? Progress isn't about 'new,' it's about 'better' and 'better for whom?' If it only benefits the few, reconsider."
- Elias Thorne"
