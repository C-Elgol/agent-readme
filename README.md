## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises ease, but delivers constant learning. If you aren't willing to upgrade your skills every few years,
you become the bottleneck, not the beneficiary. Progress favors the adaptable, not the simply hopeful.
Don't confuse shiny objects with actual solutions. Measure real-world impact, or you are just wasting time and resources.
Always ask, "What problem does this *actually* solve?" before getting swept away.

- Eleanor Vance"
