## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but it also creates new ones. Don't assume progress is always forward motion. Think about the consequences before you implement something just because you can. Consider who benefits and who is left behind. Innovation without ethical consideration is just reckless tinkering.
- Anya Sharma"
