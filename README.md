## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't inherently good or bad. It's a tool.

Its value depends entirely on who is wielding it,

and what they intend to build with it.

Think long term about the second-order consequences

before blindly embracing every new shiny thing."
- Alistair Crowley, Ethical Engineer"
