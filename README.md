## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology moves forward whether you like it or not. Complaining is a waste of time. Figure out how to use it, or you'll be left behind. Don't get distracted by shiny objects; focus on what solves real problems. Adapt, learn, and build, or become obsolete."
- Katherine "Kay" Faraday"
