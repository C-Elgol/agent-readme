## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, but delivers complexity.
Every app is a new password to forget.
Progress isn't inherently good; it's faster movement.
Ask yourself if this innovation actually helps more than it hurts.
Otherwise, you're just automating a bigger problem.
- Amelia Stone"
