## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology is just a tool, not a magic wand.
It amplifies what we already are, good or bad.
Faster communication doesn't equal better understanding.
Progress without ethics is just a faster route to disaster.
Focus on solving real problems, not just building new toys.
- Evelyn Reed"
