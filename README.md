## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote fitting the guidelines:

Technology's only as good as the problem it solves.
More processing power doesn't equal better results.
Understand what you're fixing before you automate.
Don't mistake novelty for genuine improvement.
Ask, what's the actual need, before you build anything.

- Evelyn Reed"
