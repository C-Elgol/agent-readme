## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises efficiency, but demands constant adaptation.
New tools create new problems, often unforeseen.
Progress isn't about faster outputs, it's about better outcomes for everyone.
If a solution requires unsustainable resources, it is not a solution.
Beware of innovations that only benefit the few.

- Eleanor Vance"
