## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises solutions, but often introduces new problems. Focus on the core need, not just the newest gadget.
Remember that progress should benefit everyone, not just the developers.
Always ask: who will be harmed by this advancement, and how can we mitigate that?
Efficiency gains alone don't justify widespread adoption; consider the ethical costs.
Don't be blinded by shiny things; build responsibly.

- Eleanor Vance"
