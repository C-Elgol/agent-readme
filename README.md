## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't neutral. It amplifies what's already there.
If you're building for good, it can do incredible things.
If you're building for profit alone, expect consequences.
Remember, code shapes reality, not just screens.
Responsibility is the cost of innovation.

- Ada Lovelace II"
