## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a direct and practical quote about technology:

"The latest gadget won't fix fundamental problems.
Technology amplifies what already exists.
If your business processes are broken, automation just makes them break faster.
Focus first on fixing the core issues.
Then, and only then, leverage technology for real improvement."

- Evelyn Reed"
