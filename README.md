## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology changes the world, but not always for the better.
Faster doesn't always mean smarter; efficiency doesn't equal happiness.
Remember the human cost of progress, the jobs lost and the skills forgotten.
Question the hype, scrutinize the outcomes, and build what truly benefits us all.
Don't let the shiny new object blind you to the potential downsides.

- Elias Vance"
