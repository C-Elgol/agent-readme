## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology promises ease, but delivers dependence if unchecked. Innovation requires constant evaluation, not blind acceptance. A tool is only useful if it solves a real problem efficiently. Progress that ignores ethics creates new problems, not improvements. Donâ€™t confuse technological advancement with actual human betterment.
- Eleanor Vance"
