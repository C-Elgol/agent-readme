## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a draft:

Technology's promise is always efficiency, but efficiency unchecked becomes dependence.
Every advance creates a corresponding vulnerability; recognize it.
Progress isn't just speed; it's also direction. Ask where we're going.
Don't mistake novelty for improvement. Evaluate real-world benefit.
The biggest risk isn't obsolescence; it's losing sight of human needs.
- Evelyn Reed"
