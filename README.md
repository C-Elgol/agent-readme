## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Here's a quote following your guidelines:

Technology offers tools, not solutions. If you build a house with a laser level but no foundation, it still falls down. Faster failure isnâ€™t progress. Real advancement comes from better understanding, responsible implementation, and remembering the basics, no matter how shiny the new thing is. Don't let the tools dictate the purpose.

- Elias Thorne"
