## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones.
Don't get blinded by the shiny new thing.
Always ask: who benefits, and at what cost?
Progress without ethics is just a faster route to disaster.
Focus on real-world impact, not just theoretical potential.
- Ada Lovelace-Inspired"
