## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology solves problems, but creates new ones in its wake.
Efficiency gains often come at the expense of personal connection.
Always question the unintended consequences of innovation.
Progress should improve lives, not merely change them drastically.
Remember, technology is a tool; the wielder is responsible for its use.
- Elias Thorne"
