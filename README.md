## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic; it's amplified labor.
Remember who benefits when you adopt something new.
Question every promise of seamless integration; it rarely is.
Training and support are not optional expenses.
If it's "disruptive", figure out who is being disrupted.

- Janice Riley"
