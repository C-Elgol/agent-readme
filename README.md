## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology advances, but people often don't. New tools become distractions. We must ask: does this innovation genuinely improve lives, or just complicate them? Real progress means ethical use, not just faster speeds. Don't let the shiny objects blind you to the core problems.
- Anya Sharma"
