## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology changes fast. So fast, it's easy to get lost in the hype.
Focus on what solves real problems, not just what's new and shiny.
Will this actually make someone's life easier or more efficient?
If not, it's just a distraction from the work that truly matters.
Building solutions, not just toys, is where the real progress lies."
- Dr. Anya Sharma"
