## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology isn't magic, it's a tool.
It solves problems, sure, but it creates new ones too.
Think about the unintended consequences, not just the immediate gains.
Don't get so wrapped up in the shiny new thing that you forget the old lessons.
Progress needs a compass, not just a faster engine.

- Anya Sharma"
