## ðŸ“… Daily Quote

> "Technology simplifies tasks, but rarely simplifies life.
It's a tool, not a solution.
Constant 'progress' without considering consequences is just motion.
Learn its limits before it defines yours.
Question everything, especially the shiny new thing."
- Elara Vance, Systems Analyst"
